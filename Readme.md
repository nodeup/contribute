# NodeUp

NodeUp is a community podcast. You can help if you want to.

## Shows

Would you like to hear about a Node.js topic? Please [create an issue](https://github.com/nodeup/contribute/issues) and describe the show. We usually have 3-4 people on the show, plus or including the host. If there are individuals you'd like to have on to discuss your topic, please add that information too. It's a huge help.

## Sponsor

Sponsorship rates for sponsoring NodeUp are extremely reasonable. You can help defer the costs of producing and hosting the podcast by sponsoring NodeUp or encouraging your employer to sponsor. Email nodeup@gmail.com for more information.
